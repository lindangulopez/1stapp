1.
Question 1
Which one of the following is the first gene for this strand of DNA where you want to consider all three of the stop codons?
“AATGCTAACTAGCTGACTAAT”

/*
    final String START_ATG = "ATG";
    final String END_TAG = "TAG";
    final String END_TGA = "TGA";
    final String END_TAA = "TAA";
    final String CODON_CTG = "CTG";

*/

not(CTAASTAGC; ATGCTA; empty)

2.
Question 2
Consider the following code segment to count the number of times the string “TG” occurs in the string dna, that does not work correctly.

/* 

String dna = "CTGCCTGCATGATCGTA";
int pos = dna.indexOf("TG");
int count = 0;
while (pos >= 0) {
  count = count + 1;
  pos = dna.indexOf("TG",pos);
}
System.out.println(count);

*/

Finds the same TG

3.
Question 3
Consider the following segment of code from a program.

/*
while (count < 3) {
  count += 1;
  newDna = newDna + dna.substring(startPos,pos);
  startPos = pos+1;
  pos = dna.indexOf("T", startPos);
  if (pos == -1) {
    break;
  }
}

*/

Two ways to break out: break; & while (count < 3)

Question 4
Which one of the following conditionals correctly evaluates to true if the integer num is an odd number and to false if it is an even number.

/*
if (num % 2 == 1)

*/

Example: 2%2 = 0 [false] & 3%2 = 1 [true]
